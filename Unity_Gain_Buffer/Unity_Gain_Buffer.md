# Settling Behavior and Error

Consider a finite open-loop gain op-amp with a gain of $A_0$.

Connect this in negative feedback.

The closed loop gain is given by $\frac{A_0}{1+A_0}$.

The error voltage is given by $V_{E} = V_{OUT}/A_0 = \frac{1}{1+A_0}$.

Let us take a real schematic and slow down time domain response.

## Settling - Real Circuit

Consider the below circuit.

There are some pretty cool settling to learn from here. Let us start with the operation principle of this circuit.
